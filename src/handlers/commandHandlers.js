Private jet pricing is based on several factors:

- ✈️ **Aircraft type**: Larger jets cost more but offer better amenities
- 📏 **Distance**: Longer flights require more fuel and crew time
- 📅 **Seasonality**: High-demand periods (holidays, events) increase prices
- 🏢 **Airport fees**: Some airports charge higher landing and handling fees
- ⏱️ **Positioning**: If aircraft needs to be repositioned, this adds cost

For example, a 2-hour flight on a light jet might cost **$8,000-$12,000** total, while a transatlantic flight on a heavy jet could be **$80,000-$100,000**.
